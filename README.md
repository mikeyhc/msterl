# mst [![Erlang CI](https://github.com/mikeyhc/msterl/actions/workflows/erlang.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mikeyhc/msterl/actions/workflows/erlang.yml)
A (slow and inefficient) erlang implementation of
[mustache](https://mustache.github.io/).
This was mostly to get familiar with the spec and have a bit of fun,
definitely not fit for production use.

currently passing tests:
* [x] comments
* [x] delimiters
* [ ] interpolation
* [x] inverted sections
* [x] partials
* [x] sections

* [ ] dynamic names
* [ ] inheritance
* [ ] lambdas
